High-Performance Centrality Analysis in Social Networks

• Collaborated with two teammates to develop a parallel algorithm for centrality analysis in social networks.

• We utilized Dijkstra’s and BFS algorithms for closeness centrality in Facebook and Twitter networks, with 4039 and 8130
nodes respectively. The calculated average centralities were 0.276168 for Facebook and 0.260332 for Twitter.

• For betweenness centrality, Brandes’ algorithm was used, yielding an average centrality of 0.00134. This project,
leveraging the MPI library on an HPC cluster, included advanced output features for writing detailed centrality metrics to files and displaying the top 5 nodes by centrality. It also featured real-time computation and display of average centrality values, with different processor counts.
